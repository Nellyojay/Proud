                <p>This resort was actually thought about in 2025 around the time of february and april.</p>

                <p>it was started by okudi john nelson and thought about by okudi john nelson and Nabbaale Viola Josephine in their single lonely room in naalya. This was ata time when okudi was staying alone in naalya jobless and still figuring out life wondering what to do with his life. he always had so much to think about being a jobless man it wasnr an easy thing to live with. So he had to be creative in his thoughts. And that is how this Resort idea came about.</p>

                <p>For thhose that didnt believe in him, well look at him now.</p>

                <p>At the time when he started this resort, he only had his friend Mugerwa Owen Michael, who was very surpotive in his idea of staring up the Resort Hotel out of nothing but though.</p>

                <p>For the most time he spent his entire time wondering how to start this Resort Hotel but after a while he manged to actually get and idea on how to start it and it set off very fast immediately he stared it</p>

                <p>It is mostly a miracle that he even manged to make it happen because everybody thought that this was not going to be possible but well, here we are now.</p>
